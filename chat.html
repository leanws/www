A chat icon on your website might be one of your advantages over the competitors.</p><p>We offer affordable on-line chat service to our customers. You can chat with your customers using your desktop/laptop or smart phone.</p><p>We are able to keep low price on chat because we use modern web technologies. The downside is that our chat system will not work with an obsolete web browser (e.g., Internet Explorer). <span class="chatImpossible" style="display:none;color:red">Unfortulately, our chat system is incompatible with this browser.</span></p><p class="chatAvailable">To test our chat system, open chat window by clicking the tab on the right.</p><p>Please visit <a class="wiki" href="custom">custom order page</a> to include chat system in your order.</p><h2>Prices</h2><p>Installation: $30.<br>Monthly fee: $1 unless you use it really hard, see below.</p><h2>30 megabytes of traffic</h2><p>We charge $1/month for the chat service if your chat traffic does not exceed 30 megabytes.  This is usually enough for small business (for example, the size of &quot;War and Peace&quot; – 1274 pages – by Leo Tolstoy is less than 8 megabytes).  For larger data amounts there is a fee of $1 per every 30 megabytes transmitted.</p></article><article class="story center" ><h2>Protection from prank</h2><p>To make it more accessible we do not use captcha for the chat service. A website visitor who has sent 10 messages and did not receive any response from the operator gets temporary banned.</p><p>There is a size limit of 50 kbytes per message, which is approximately 10.000 words. (Can be changed by request.)</p></article><article class="story center" ><h2>Chat status</h2><p>There are three chat states: green, orange, and red.</p><p>Green means that the operator is fully available and can respond fast. Orange means that the operator is partially available, but still can respond within several minutes. Red means that the operator is not available. (S)he will still receive the messages, but will not respond within a reasonable time. When the chat status is red (unavailable), the chat icon on the right is hidden, so a new chat can not be initiated.</p><p>Switching chat states on a website is easy: for example, to change it on leanws.com, one should visit <a class="wiki" href="https://leanws.com/cs/set">https://leanws.com/cs/set</a>.</p><p>The address <a class="wiki" href="https://leanws.com/cs/set">https://leanws.com/cs/set</a> is password-protected to prevent unauthorized usage.</p></article><article class="story center"><h2>Technical details</h2><p>All chats are connected to the Operator's (website owner's) <a href="https://telegram.org/" class="wiki">telegram</a> account. Operator chats using his/her laptop and/or smartphpone or other similar device powered by Windows, MacOS, Android, or Linux.</p><p>Emoji symbols are partially supported. They can be sent by the Operator, but not by the website Visitor (customer).</p><p>The Operator can chat with several Visitors simultaneously.</p><p>The chat history is stored for 3 days. If the Visitor decides to resume the chat within three days, previous messages will be displayed when (s)he opens the chat window. For the Operator, the chat history is stored on <a href="https://telegram.org/" class="wiki">telegram</a> servers until (s)he decides to clean it.</p></article></div><footer id="footer" style="font-family:'Gillius';background-color:#333;color:#C7C7C7;padding-top:2em"> </footer><a id="goup" href="#">1</a></body></html>
